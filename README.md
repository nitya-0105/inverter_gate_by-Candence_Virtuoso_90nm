CMOS Inverter Analysis (GPDK 90nm)
This repository contains the complete design and analysis of a CMOS Inverter using GPDK 90nm technology in Cadence Virtuoso. The project walks through the fundamental steps involved in understanding the behavior of an inverter circuit at the transistor level, including

Schematic Design of the CMOS inverter
Transient Analysis – Switching behavior, delay, rise/fall time
DC Transfer Characteristics – VTC curve, noise margins
Layout Design following 90nm PDK rules
DRC (Design Rule Check) and LVS (Layout vs Schematic) verification
Post-layout simulation with extracted parasitics

Key Learnings:
How NMOS and PMOS work together to create inverter logic
Effect of transistor sizing on performance
Understanding propagation delay
Basics of layout design and physical verification in backend flow

Tools Used:
Cadence Virtuoso (for schematic, simulation & layout)
GPDK 90nm PDK
Spectre (for simulations)

Special thanks to Preet Jain Sir for the valuable guidance on the CMOS design flow and layout insights, and to **SVITS** for providing access to tools and lab facilities.
